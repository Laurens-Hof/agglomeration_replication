# agglomeration_replication
A python project I made for one of my courses. How large are agglomeration effects in Europe?

Ciccone (2002) uses an instrumental variable to estimate the size of agglomeration effects within European countries. I replicate his analysis with newer Eurostat data. It contains a sample of academic writing, application of 2-stage-least-squares methods, data cleaning, joins, pivots, and graphs.
