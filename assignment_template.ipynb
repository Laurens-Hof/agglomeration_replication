It is therefore very relevant to policy to have an unbiased and up-to-date estimate of the size of this effect. The original paper was published in 2002 and uses data from the late 1980's, which can raise doubts as to whether the conclusions still hold today. However, replicating it is relatively straightforward since almost all the necessary data are made freely available by Eurostat."

    "I follow the original author in their set-up. They derive their estimating equation from the following specification of a production function for a unit of land:\n",
    "\n",
    "$q = \\Omega_{sc} \\left(\\left(nH\\right)^\\beta k^{1-\\beta}\\right)^\\alpha \\left(\\frac{Q_{sc}}{A_{sc}}\\right)^{(\\lambda - 1)/\\lambda}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $0\\leq\\beta\\leq1$ and $0\\leq\\alpha\\leq1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $q$ denotes the output produced on the unit of land. $\\Omega_{sc}$ denotes unexplained total factor productivity for region $s$ within country (or larger region) $c$. $n$ is the number of workers on the unit of land and $H$ is their average human capital. $k$ is the amount of physical capital employed. $Q_{sc}$ and $A_{sc}$ are supposed to be the source of the agglomeration effects: they denote total production and total land in the region respectively, again for region $s$ within country $c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific form of this production function contains some assumptions that were likely chosen for convenience, but which are not very controversial. At its core it is a very standard Cobb-Douglas production function with labor-enhancing human capital. $\\alpha$ captures the returns to capital and labor on the unit of land, which are distributed according to $\\beta\\$. The first step towards turning this production function into an estimable equation is the (rather strong) assumption that capital and labor are distributed among the units of land in the region. Then,\n",
    "\n",
    "$Q_{sc} = A_{sc} q$\n",
    "\n",
    "which, after substituting the first equation and solving for average labor productivity yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{Q_{sc}}{N_{sc}} = \\Omega^\\lambda \\left( H_{sc}^\\beta \\left(\\frac{K_{sc}}{N_{sc}}\\right)^{1-\\beta}\\right)^{\\alpha\\lambda} \\left( \\frac{N_{sc}} {A_{sc}} \\right) ^{\\alpha\\lambda - 1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation only uses local aggregates as variables: $K_{sc}$ and $N_{sc}$ are total capital and total amount of workers within area $s$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation requires information on the capital density within each area, which is not available. However, this problem can be circumvented by assuming that the rental rate of capital, $r$, is equal across a country. Then, assuming that capital gets hired until the market clears, we can use capital demand as a substitute. This is equal to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$K_{sc} = \\frac {\\alpha \\left(1 - \\beta \\right)}{r_c} Q_{sc}$\n",

    "Here, $\\Lambda_c$ depends on the country-wide rental rate of capital, and the convenient thing is that it can be accounted for using country-level fixed effects. This is very close the estimating equation, and the new variable is $\\theta$. This is the coefficient we are going to be estimating, and it is what is capturing the agglomeration effects. It is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\theta = \\frac{\\alpha \\lambda -1} {1 - \\alpha \\lambda \\left(1 - \\beta \\right)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\theta$ measures the manner in which the density of human capital and employment affect local labor productivity. It should be thought of as a \"net agglomeration effect\", in the sense that it is determined by the product of $\\alpha$ and $\\lambda$. $\\lambda$ captures the extent to which density of production increases production efficiency, while $\\alpha$ captures the extent to which there are diminishing returns to capital and labor within a unit of land. If this product is smaller than 1, $\\theta$ is negative and increasing density reduces average labor productivity declines with employment density. If the product is equal to 1, $\\theta$ is 0 and employment density is irrelevant. Finally, if $\\alpha \\lambda$ is greater than 1, it is positive and employment density increases regional labor productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be emphasized that $\\theta$ measures the effect of employment density on local **labor productivity**, not total factor productivity. A good way to think about it is to conceptualize $\\theta$ as the \"net agglomeration effect *after capital arbitrage*\". After all, we our assumptions until this point imply that capital moves to the places where it can be employed most productively. As a consequence, the magnitude of $\\theta$ becomes larger as $\\beta$ (the relative productivity of labor) becomes smaller. One might ask why labor does not move to its most productive location. The easiest answer to this is that workers apparently experience amenities in less dense places, or disamenities in denser places (congestion, pollution, etc.). It could also be that workers are compensated in the form of lower-cost housing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking logs of the capital-corrected average productivity expression implies that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\ln Q_{sc} - \\ln N_{sc} = \\ln \\Lambda_c + \\theta \\left(\\ln N_{sc} - \\ln A_{sc} \\right) + (\\theta + 1) \\ln H_{sc} + \\ln \\Omega_{sc}$\n",

    "\n",
    "Where $W$ is a collection of coefficients for each level of education, indicating which fraction of the population has attained that level of education, and Z is a set of country-level fixed effects. Since this is a log-log regression, $\\theta_1$ can be interpreted as an elasticity: \"if employment density increases by 1 percent, this will have an x percent increase/decrease in labor productivity as a consequence\"."

Like the original author, I will use data on the NUTS-3 level for Germany, the UK, Italy and Spain. The original paper includes France, but I have omitted it since there do not seem to be employment data available at the NUTS-3 level for France. NUTS-3 regions correspond to *kreise* in Germany, *counties* in the UK, *provincie* in Italy and *provincias* in Spain (or COROP-regions in the Netherlands).\n",

    "This setup has some reverse causality problems: is production more efficient because it is close together, or does production cluster because it is more productive in that place? The author addresses this by selecting countries for which the NUTS-3 divisions are historically predetermined, and then using land area as an instrumental variable, since it turns out that land area and employment density are negatively correlated.The explanation the author posits is that, since the historical divisions were usually made for administrative purposes, which made it \"common sense\" to roughly equalize population size across regions. This caused a negative correlation between land area and population density, which in turn persisted to the present day in causing a negative correlation between area and employment density.\n",
    "\n",
    "The argument for exclusion of this instrument rests on the supposition that late 19th century population density has no effect on current-day productivity, except through its effect on current-day employment density.

This is expected, as they are known for having a small number of relatively very large cities (places like Barcelona and Madrid in the case of Spain, and Rome and Milan in the case of Italy). Meanwhile, the UK has some downward outliers, which most likely represent sparse counties in the Scottish and Welsh Highlands."

    "In conclusion, my replication indicates that net agglomeration effects could be a lot lower than estimated in Ciccone (2002), and does not even conclusively reject the null hypothesis. There are several possible explanations for this. The first is simply that the exlcusion of French regions from the data is what causes the difference. After all, France is a country known for having a small number of prosperous metropolitan areas and rural areas that do poorly by comparison. Another explanation is that something has changed structurally within the European economy over the past 30 years, reducing the strength of agglomeration effects. Since the estimate measures net agglomeration, this could also be driven by things like a structural increase in congestion externalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have no reason to expect the local elasticity of productivity to be constant along all possible densities. It could be that, if there is a different density spread now than there was 30 years ago, that drives the difference in estimates. If this is true, it is a very intuitive explanation: employers cluster to take advantage of agglomeration effects, and they stop this \"arbitrage\" once the net effects approach zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to improve this project in later versions. The first, and most obvious one, is to find employment data for France and include it in the analysis. A second way is to find better data on education, such that it can be controlled for at the NUTS-3 level instead of at the NUTS-2 level. A final way is to control for spillover effects, like in the original paper. However, this had a negligible impact and I could not find an easy way to implement it."
